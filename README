Lttngtop is an ncurses interface for reading and browsing traces recorded by
the LTTng tracer and displaying various statistics.
As of now, the cpu usage, per file/process I/O bandwidth and perf counters are
displayed. This release is the first one that handles live sessions as well as
offline sessions.

USAGE
-----

The manpage located in the doc folder of this source tree documents the usage
of LTTngTop.

BUILDING
--------

	./bootstrap (skip if using tarball)
	./configure
	make
	make install

DEPENDENCIES
------------

To compile Babeltrace and lttngtop, you need:

	gcc 3.2 or better
	libc6 development librairies
	  (Debian : libc6, libc6-dev)
	  (Fedora : glibc, glibc)
	glib 2.22 or better development libraries
	  (Debian : libglib2.0-0, libglib2.0-dev)
	  (Fedora : glib2, glib2-devel)
	libpopt >= 1.13 development libraries
	  (Debian : libpopt-dev)
	  (Fedora : popt)
	ncurses development libraries
	  (Debian : libncurses5-dev)
	babeltrace = 1.2.3 development library

To use the local live tracing feature, you need:
	lttng-tools >= 2.4
	lttng-modules >= 2.4
	babeltrace = 1.2.4

For developers using the git tree:

This source tree is based on the autotools suite from GNU to simplify
portability. Here are some things you should have on your system in order to
compile the git repository tree :

- GNU autotools (automake >=1.10, autoconf >=2.50, autoheader >=2.50)
  (make sure your system wide "automake" points to a recent version!)
- GNU Libtool >=2.2
  (for more information, go to http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/)

If you get the tree from the repository, you will need to use the "bootstrap"
script in the root of the tree. It calls all the GNU tools needed to prepare the
tree configuration.
